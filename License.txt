2. OWNERSHIP
The Software is the property of Developer and is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties.

3.2 You shall not modify, reverse engineer, disassemble, reverse compile, distribute, rent, lease, assign or transfer the Software, nor shall you create any derivative works of the Software.

In no event will Developer be liable for any damages, including but not limited to any lost profits, lost savings or any incidental or consequential damages, whether resulting from impaired or lost data, software or computer failure or any other cause, or for any other claim by user or for any third party claim. If any warranty, disclaimer or limitation on liability in this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, then Developers total liability to you (whether based in contract or tort, or otherwise) will in no event exceed the Software license fees paid by you to Developer.
