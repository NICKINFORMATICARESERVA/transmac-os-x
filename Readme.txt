TransMac V14.1 Information

To install unzip archive and run setup.exe.

WARNING: After attaching a Mac format disk drive, Windows may display a dialog offering to format it. DO NOT SELECT FORMAT! Windows does this because it does not recognize Mac format disks. Just cancel that window without formatting and run TransMac. Click the drive in the left pane of the TransMac window. You can then browse the drive and copy files from within TransMac.

For more help on using TransMac, select "Help Contents" from the Help menu or press F1.
